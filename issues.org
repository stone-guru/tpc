 TPC issues
* Transaction Control Features
** DONE Timeout control should implemented by tc itself instead of using mina idle
the reasons are:
- after connection closed idle message will not triger, so when
  connection closed check action should be performed.
- Let these mechannism dont depend on outside is more safer.
*** Panticipants should query decision command after vote yes and decision not arriving
* Network layer
** simplify Message struct, remove XXX_REPLY command code, just return code is ok.
** DONE MinaChannel use mina's AttritbuteKey to store var to IOSession in. ROUNT_REFan d NODE
* Bank Business
** Num of digital after the point is not "precision", another method way should be find out.
